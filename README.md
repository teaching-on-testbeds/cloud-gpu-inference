# Using cloud servers for GPU-based inference

To run this experiment on Chameleon, open a terminal inside the Chameleon Jupyter environment and run

```
cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/teaching-on-testbeds/cloud-gpu-inference
```

Then, open the notebook inside the `cloud-gpu-inference` directory and follow along with the instructions there.

> Note: This experiment assumes that you already have a lease for an RTX6000 GPU server on CHI@UC!
